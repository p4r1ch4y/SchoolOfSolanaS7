Authority ID : 13DQ49SPqoxZRxDEXcGPnXjBprXmRnJoXbMXk6KgMRHz

## Features

- **User-generated PDA as Journal**: Each user gets their own journal account using Program Derived Addresses
- **Daily Idea Streak Tracking**: Maintains streak counter for consecutive days with idea logging
- **Idea Storage**: Stores up to 20 ideas per user with full text (280 characters max) and timestamps
- **Account Size Optimization**: Efficient memory usage to fit within Solana's 10KB account limits
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 12 test cases covering all functionality with industry-standard single test file

## Built Using

```bash
anchor init

# Tested using consolidated test suite
./setup-fresh.sh               #fesh setup for testing, clears old data so tests are done in a fresh manner
anchor test                    # Standard anchor testing
./test-universal.sh           # Universal script that works without deployment issues
cargo test                    # Rust unit tests
```

## Test Coverage

**Single Comprehensive Test File**: `daily_idea_spark.spec.ts` - standard approach
- âœ… **Program Setup** (3 tests): Program loading, method availability, account types
- âœ… **Journal Initialization** (2 tests): New journal creation, duplicate prevention  
- âœ… **Idea Logging** (4 tests): First idea, streak increment, validation (empty/too long)
- âœ… **Streak Management** (2 tests): Streak retrieval, account isolation
- âœ… **Ideas Array Management** (1 test): 20-item limit maintenance with FIFO trimming

## Latest Updates

- **UI Improvements**: Fixed dark/light mode theme issues with proper contrast
- **Stack Overflow Fix**: Optimized vector operations to prevent compilation stack overflow
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced max ideas from 30 to 20 for better performance
- **Test Consolidation**: Combined 3 previous separate test files into 1 comprehensive suite following industry standards<<<<<<< HEAD

## Testing Instructions

## Program Testing 

**For Program Testing**: The easiest approach is the universal test script that automatically handles all scenarios.

### Universal Testing (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo-url>
cd anchor_project
yarn install
./setup-fresh.sh  #fesh setup for testing, clears old data so tests are done in a fresh manner
# Run comprehensive tests (automatically detects scenario)
./test-universal.sh
```

**What it does:**
- **Detects** if original program exists on devnet â†’ tests against it  
- **Detects** if fresh deployment needed â†’ deploys and tests
- **Handles** funding and network configuration automatically
- **Works** with any wallet (no special permissions needed)

### Manual Testing Options

#### Option A: Test Against Existing Program
```bash
# Test the deployed program without redeploying
ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com yarn run ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 tests/daily_idea_spark.spec.ts
```

#### Option B: Fresh Deployment
```bash
# Setup fresh deployment (for completely independent testing)
./setup-fresh.sh
anchor test
```

### Troubleshooting

**Program ID Mismatch Error**: This happens when the compiled program ID doesn't match the declare_id in source code.

**Quick Fix for Testing Common Errors:**
```bash
# Remove existing keypair and let Anchor generate new one
rm -f target/deploy/daily_idea_spark-keypair.json
anchor test
```

This creates a fresh deployment that will work regardless of the original program state.


#  For Program Testing

This section provides **foolproof testing instructions** for testing after rebuilding this repository fresh.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone 
cd anchor_project
yarn install

# 2. Run tests (choose ONE of these approaches)

# Option A: Universal script (handles everything automatically)
./test-universal.sh

# Option B: Fresh deployment (if you want your own instance)
rm -f target/deploy/daily_idea_spark-keypair.json
anchor test

# Option C: Manual test against existing program (fastest)
ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com yarn test
```

##  If You Get "Program ID Mismatch" Error

This is the most common issue when testing downloaded code. **Easy fix:**

```bash
# Remove the existing keypair file
rm -f target/deploy/daily_idea_spark-keypair.json

# Run anchor test - it will create new keypair and deploy fresh
anchor test
```

**Why this happens**: The repository includes a keypair file that generates a specific Program ID, but when you download fresh code, you don't have access to deploy to that existing program. Removing the keypair forces Anchor to create a new one you control.

## Expected Test Results

You should see:
```
 12 tests passing
 All core functionality verified:
   - Program initialization
   - Journal creation and management  
   - Idea logging with streak tracking
   - Ideas array with 20-item limit
   - Account isolation between users
   - Error handling for edge cases
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Insufficient funds" or Airdrop failures
**Solution**: The tests include automatic funding fallbacks. If faucet is rate-limited:
1. Wait 5 minutes and retry
2. Get SOL manually from https://faucet.solana.com
3. Or use a wallet with existing devnet SOL

### Issue: Tests pass but show wrong Program ID
**This is normal** - when you deploy fresh, you get a new Program ID. The functionality is identical.

### Issue: Network/RPC errors
**Solution**: Tests automatically configure devnet. If issues persist:
```bash
solana config set --url devnet
```

## What Makes This Production-Ready

- **Comprehensive Testing**: 12 test cases covering all functionality
- **Memory Optimized**: Fits within Solana's 10KB account limits
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation for all edge cases  
- **Account Isolation**: Each user gets independent journal storage
- **Industry Standards**: Single consolidated test file, clean architecture

## Technical Overview

- **Program**: Anchor-based Solana program with PDA-based user journals
- **Frontend**: Next.js with beautiful card-based UI supporting dark/light themes
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with automatic funding and network configuration
- **Deployment**: Devnet-ready with existing deployed instance for quick evaluation

---

**Total Testing Time**: ~2-5 minutes depending on network conditions
**All 12 tests should pass** demonstrating full functionality

## Architecture Highlights

- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized to avoid stack overflow issues in Solana runtime
- **Scalable**: Each user gets isolated journal account via PDA
- **Robust**: Comprehensive error handling and validation
- **Production Ready**: Deployed and tested on devnet with all edge cases covered
